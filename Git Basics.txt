This file has basics of using Git, we use git and github to track changes of our files 

1. always check status of git in any folder (repository) : git status
2. change the repo into a git repo by initialising : git init
3. Stage all the files from working directory to staging : git add .
4. Commit the files i.e saving the files : git commit -m "here we give text like version 1"
that means files commited in version 1
5. add your username and email , if we want the same name and email we can change that in global or we can 
do it for a particular repo as well : git config --global user.name"Gurneesh Singh" , same line for email
6. To view the changes made to the files : git log
