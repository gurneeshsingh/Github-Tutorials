This file has basics of using Git, we use git and github to track changes of our files 

1. always check status of git in any folder (repository) : git status
2. change the repo into a git repo by initialising : git init
3. Stage all the files from working directory to staging : git add .
4. Commit the files i.e saving the files : git commit -m "here we give text like version 1"
that means files commited in version 1
5. add your username and email , if we want the same name and email we can change that in global or we can 
do it for a particular repo as well : git config --global user.name"Gurneesh Singh" , same line for email
6. To view the changes made to the files : git log
7. Only commit files when sure of the changes done. 
8. If changes made to different files but not staged , we want to reverse the changes : git checkout .
9. If changes made to files and staged , we eant to reverse the changes then : git reset . + git checkout .
10. If we want to clone any repo from github to our machine we use : git clone ssh key 


GITHUB TUTORIAL
1. Firstly we add a ssh key to authorise the local machine to access the github account to push and pull files
2. Next we add origin to tell github to locate the origin from where it will take requests :
git remote add origin {followed by the link in the github profile reporitory tab}
3. To push code from our machine to github : git push -u origin master
